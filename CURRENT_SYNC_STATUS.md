# Current Sync Status & Next Steps

## üî¥ Background Sync is NOT Running

### Current Configuration

The MCP server is running but WITHOUT background sync enabled:

```json
{
  "LIMITLESS_API_KEY": "your-api-key-here"
  // Missing: LIMITLESS_ENABLE_SYNC, LIMITLESS_ENABLE_VECTOR
}
```

### To Enable Background Sync

1. **Update Claude Desktop Config**:

   ```bash
   ~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json
   ```

   Add these environment variables:

   ```json
   {
     "mcpServers": {
       "limitless": {
         "command": "node",
         "args": ["/path/to/limitless-ai-mcp-server/dist/index.js"],
         "env": {
           "LIMITLESS_API_KEY": "your-api-key-here",
           "LIMITLESS_ENABLE_SYNC": "true",
           "LIMITLESS_ENABLE_VECTOR": "true",
           "LIMITLESS_SYNC_INTERVAL": "60000"
         }
       }
     }
   }
   ```

2. **Restart Claude Desktop** for changes to take effect

3. **Verify Sync is Running**:
   - Use the `limitless_sync_status` tool
   - Should show "Phase: IDLE" and "isRunning: true"

## What Background Sync Does

When enabled, the sync service will:

- Check for new lifelogs every 60 seconds
- Download any new recordings automatically
- Add them to the vector database
- Make them immediately searchable

## Monitoring New Data (Not Yet Implemented)

The current sync service downloads new data but doesn't have:

- ‚ùå Real-time notifications when new data arrives
- ‚ùå Automatic summaries of new content
- ‚ùå A monitoring dashboard
- ‚ùå Webhook/email alerts

See `MONITORING_PLAN.md` for implementation roadmap.

## Quick Test

After enabling sync, you can test by:

1. Make a recording with your Pendant
2. Wait 60-120 seconds
3. Search for keywords from your recording
4. Check sync status to see if it found new data

## Alternative: Manual Sync

If you don't want background sync running continuously:

```bash
# Run periodic manual sync
npm run sync:all
```

This gives you control over when API calls are made.
