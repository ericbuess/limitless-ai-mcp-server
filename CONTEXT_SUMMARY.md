# Context Summary - Limitless AI MCP Server Phase 2

## Session Overview (2025-06-04)

Implemented major improvements to the sync system after user feedback about being respectful of the beta API.

## What Was Accomplished

### 1. Initial Testing

- Found that searches were 100% local but only had 25 lifelogs (stale data)
- Discovered no background sync was running
- Identified need for bulk historical download

### 2. Sync Service V3 Implementation

Created a completely redesigned sync service with these improvements:

#### Key Changes from V2:

1. **Batch-Level Checkpointing**

   - Saves after EVERY batch (not every 100 items)
   - Tracks processed batches to avoid duplicates
   - Can resume exactly where left off

2. **No Arbitrary Limits**

   - Removed 365-day limit
   - Removed "stop after 30 empty days" logic
   - Searches back full configured years (default 10)
   - Handles gaps in recordings properly

3. **Two-Phase Approach**

   - Phase 1: Download to local files (.md + .meta.json)
   - Phase 2: Build embeddings from local files
   - Never re-downloads data once saved

4. **Respectful API Usage**
   - 2-second delays between requests
   - Batch processing to minimize calls
   - Proper error handling

### 3. Files Modified/Created

- `src/vector-store/sync-service-v3.ts` - New improved sync service
- `src/tools/sync-all-data-v3.ts` - CLI tool for syncing
- `src/tools/enhanced-handlers.ts` - Updated to use V3
- `package.json` - Added sync scripts
- `SYNC_V3_IMPROVEMENTS.md` - Documentation
- `SYNC_TEST_RESULTS.md` - Test results
- Updated README.md and other docs

### 4. Testing Results

Successfully tested the system:

- ✅ API delays working (2 seconds)
- ✅ Checkpoint saves after every batch
- ✅ Duplicate detection working
- ✅ Graceful interruption
- ✅ Resume from checkpoint

## Current State

The project now has:

1. Phase 2 search (59x faster) - COMPLETE
2. Background sync V3 - COMPLETE
3. Bulk historical download - COMPLETE
4. All 9 MCP tools working
5. Full documentation

## Next Steps (Future Sessions)

### Phase 3: Parallel Search Execution

- Implement p-limit for controlled concurrency
- Add worker threads for embeddings
- Parallelize search strategies

### Phase 6: Action Detection (User mentioned)

- Process new transcripts for action triggers
- Use Claude CLI to detect intents
- Execute actions based on voice commands
- Example: "Hey Limitless, remind me to..."

## Key Commands

```bash
# Set API key
export LIMITLESS_API_KEY="your-api-key-here"

# Run full sync (respectful of API)
npm run sync:all

# With options
npm run sync:all -- --years=5 --batch=30 --delay=3000

# Rebuild embeddings (no API calls)
npm run sync:rebuild
```

## Important Context

1. **API Key**: your-api-key-here
2. **Search Performance**: 100ms local searches after sync
3. **Data Storage**: ./data/lifelogs/YYYY/MM/DD/
4. **Vector Store**: LanceDB with Contextual RAG
5. **Sync Status**: Use `limitless_sync_status` tool

## Technical Details

- Downloads in batches (default 50 days)
- Saves checkpoint after every batch
- Never re-downloads existing data
- Can handle 100K+ days efficiently
- Respectful 2-second API delays

The sync system is now production-ready and safe for downloading ALL historical data without abusing the API.
