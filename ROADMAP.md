## Phase 2 Enhancements (Post-MVP)

### 5. Local Vector Store for Semantic Search

Enable offline access and fast semantic search through local vector embeddings.

#### 5.1 Vector Store Implementation
- [ ] Set up vector database (ChromaDB, Weaviate, or FAISS)
- [ ] Implement embedding generation for lifelog content
- [ ] Create daily sync mechanism to download new lifelogs
- [ ] Build hybrid search (check local first, fallback to API)
- [ ] Add semantic similarity search capabilities
- [ ] Implement offline mode support

#### 5.2 Search Enhancement
- [ ] Add natural language query understanding
- [ ] Implement relevance ranking based on embeddings
- [ ] Support complex semantic queries ("meetings about project X")
- [ ] Add query expansion for better recall
- [ ] Create search analytics

**Files to create:**
- `src/vector-store/manager.ts` - Vector store management
- `src/vector-store/embeddings.ts` - Embedding generation
- `src/vector-store/sync.ts` - Daily sync service
- `src/vector-store/search.ts` - Semantic search implementation

### 6. Voice-Activated Keyword Monitoring System

Transform the Pendant into a voice-command system by monitoring for keywords and triggering actions.

#### 6.1 Monitoring Service
- [ ] Create background service polling recent lifelogs (30-60s intervals)
- [ ] Implement efficient delta checking (only new content)
- [ ] Add configurable polling intervals
- [ ] Create monitoring dashboard/status
- [ ] Implement pause/resume functionality

#### 6.2 Keyword Detection System
- [ ] Define keyword configuration schema
- [ ] Implement exact match detection ("Hey Limitless")
- [ ] Add pattern matching ("Action item: *", "Remind me to *")
- [ ] Support context-aware keywords ("urgent", "important")
- [ ] Create keyword validation and testing tools

#### 6.3 Action Registry & Execution
- [ ] Create action mapping system (keyword → action)
- [ ] Implement action types:
  - [ ] Create task/reminder
  - [ ] Send notification
  - [ ] Trigger webhook
  - [ ] Execute MCP tool
  - [ ] Calendar integration
- [ ] Add action confirmation/logging

#### 6.4 Notification System
- [ ] Real-time alerts when keywords detected
- [ ] Action execution confirmations
- [ ] Error/failure notifications
- [ ] Daily summary of triggered actions
- [ ] Integration with notification services

**Example Use Cases:**
- "Hey Limitless, remind me to call John tomorrow" → Creates reminder
- "Action item: review the budget proposal" → Adds to task list
- "Note to self: great idea about..." → Saves to notes
- "Urgent: need to fix the..." → High-priority notification
- "Schedule meeting with Sarah next week" → Calendar event

**Files to create:**
- `src/monitoring/keyword-monitor.ts` - Main monitoring service
- `src/monitoring/keyword-detector.ts` - Keyword detection logic
- `src/monitoring/action-registry.ts` - Action mapping and execution
- `src/monitoring/notification-service.ts` - Alert system
- `src/types/monitoring.ts` - Type definitions
- `config/keywords.json` - Default keyword configurations
