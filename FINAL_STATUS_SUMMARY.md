# Final Status Summary - Limitless AI MCP Server

## Current State (2025-06-04 @ 29% context)

### âœ… Server Running Successfully

- **New API Key**: Active and working
- **Sync Service**: Running with 60-second intervals
- **Vector Database**: LanceDB with 50 lifelogs indexed
- **Monitor Script**: Watching for new recordings

### How Sync V3 Actually Works

1. **Initial Bulk Download** (Phase 1)

   - Downloads ALL historical data ONCE when no local data exists
   - Saves as `.md` files in `data/lifelogs/YYYY/MM/DD/`
   - Saves metadata in `.meta.json` files
   - Uses checkpoint to track progress (can resume if interrupted)
   - **Never re-downloads** existing files

2. **Vectorization** (Phase 2)

   - After download completes, builds embeddings from local `.md` files
   - No API calls during this phase
   - Stores embeddings in LanceDB

3. **Monitoring Mode** (Ongoing)
   - Checks every 60 seconds for NEW lifelogs only
   - Downloads only recordings that don't exist locally
   - Immediately adds to vector database

### Current Status

- **50 lifelogs** downloaded and stored locally
- Sync is checking older dates (June 2024) but finding no new data
- Will eventually complete initial scan and switch to monitoring mode
- Monitor script (`monitor-sync.js`) watching for new arrivals

### To Test New Recording Detection

1. Make a new recording with your Pendant
2. Wait 60-120 seconds
3. Check `monitor.log` for: "ðŸŽ‰ Found 1 new lifelog(s)!"
4. The new recording will be:
   - Downloaded as `.md` file
   - Added to vector database
   - Immediately searchable

### Key Files for Reference

- `SYNC_V3_IMPROVEMENTS.md` - Complete sync system documentation
- `MONITORING_PLAN.md` - Roadmap for notification features
- `DOCUMENTATION_CLEANUP.md` - Plan to reorganize docs
- `server.log` - Real-time server logs
- `monitor.log` - Monitor script output

### Not Yet Implemented

- Real-time notifications (webhook/email)
- AI-powered automatic summaries
- Dashboard UI

### Commands

```bash
# Check server logs
tail -f server.log

# Check monitor logs
tail -f monitor.log

# Check sync status (in MCP)
Use tool: limitless_sync_status

# Manual sync if needed
npm run sync:all
```

The system is working correctly - it's just finishing the initial scan of historical dates before settling into monitor mode.
