# Monitoring Plan - Limitless AI MCP Server

## Current Status

- **System Date**: June 4, 2025 (not January 6 as user mentioned)
- **Files Downloaded**: 25 lifelogs stored locally
- **Storage Structure**: `/data/lifelogs/YYYY/MM/DD/`
- **Last Sync**: Files from May 29 - June 4, 2025

## Issues Fixed

1. ✅ **[Object Object] in Headings** - Fixed in file-manager.ts
2. ✅ **Date Formatting** - Now using ISO format for consistency
3. ✅ **Monitoring Mode** - Added to sync-service-v3.ts
4. ❓ **Date Confusion** - System date is June 4, not January 6
5. ⏳ **New Recording Detection** - Monitoring mode will check every 60 seconds

## Next Steps

1. **Delete the checkpoint file** to reset sync state:

   ```bash
   rm data/sync-checkpoint.json
   ```

2. **Restart the server** to activate monitoring mode:

   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

3. **Monitor the logs** to see if new recordings are detected:
   - Look for "Starting monitoring mode" message
   - Check for "Found X new lifelogs during monitoring check"
   - Monitoring checks happen every 60 seconds

## Expected Behavior

After restart with monitoring mode:

1. Server will complete any pending download/vectorization
2. Transition to monitoring mode
3. Check for new lifelogs every 60 seconds
4. Download and index any new recordings automatically

## Testing New Recording Detection

1. Create a new recording in Limitless app
2. Wait up to 60 seconds
3. Check server logs for "Found 1 new lifelogs during monitoring check"
4. Verify new file appears in `/data/lifelogs/2025/06/04/`

## Troubleshooting

If new recordings aren't detected:

1. Check if API is returning the recordings:

   ```bash
   curl -X GET "https://api.limitless.ai/v1/lifelogs/recent?limit=5" \
     -H "X-API-Key: your-key"
   ```

2. Check timezone settings - API uses UTC
3. Verify monitoring mode is active in logs
4. Ensure no errors in monitoring checks
