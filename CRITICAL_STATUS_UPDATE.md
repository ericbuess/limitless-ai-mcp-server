# Critical Status Update - Sync Issues

## Current Situation (17% context remaining)

### Problems Identified

1. **Server Not Running** - The MCP server stopped and needs to be restarted
2. **Only June 3rd Downloaded** - Other dates show as processed but have no files
3. **Sync Service Bug** - The sync is marking batches as "processed" without actually downloading files
4. **No New Recording Detection** - User's recent recording (made ~1 hour ago) not captured

### Root Cause

The sync service has a critical bug in `sync-service-v3.ts`:

- It processes date ranges in batches
- If API returns no data OR errors, it still marks the batch as "processed"
- This prevents re-downloading on subsequent runs
- The checkpoint system is preventing recovery

### Data Status

- **June 3, 2025**: 25 files downloaded ✅
- **June 1, 2025**: Empty directory ❌
- **June 2, 2025**: Empty directory ❌
- **June 4, 2025**: Empty directory ❌ (TODAY - missing user's recent recording)

### Immediate Fix Needed

1. **Clear the checkpoint** to force re-download:

```bash
rm data/sync-checkpoint.json
```

2. **Modify sync to use individual date queries** (not ranges):

```bash
# Change from:
listLifelogsByRange(start, end)  # Buggy - returns incomplete data

# To:
listLifelogsByDate(date)  # Works correctly
```

3. **Start server with small batch size**:

```bash
export LIMITLESS_API_KEY=sk-a740f4f7-fb38-4a20-8286-43549ab21157
export LIMITLESS_ENABLE_SYNC=true
export LIMITLESS_ENABLE_VECTOR=true
export LIMITLESS_SYNC_INTERVAL=60000
node dist/index.js
```

### To Get User's Recent Recording

The recording from ~1 hour ago is sitting on Limitless servers but not downloaded locally. Once sync is fixed and running:

1. It will download June 4th data (today)
2. Find the recent recording
3. Add to vector database
4. User can search for it

### Monitor Commands

```bash
# Watch for new downloads
tail -f server.log | grep -i "download"

# Check file creation
watch -n 5 "ls -la data/lifelogs/2025/06/*/ | grep -c '.md'"

# Monitor sync status
tail -f monitor.log
```

### Critical Code Fix Needed

In `sync-service-v3.ts`, the `performDownload` method needs to:

1. Query individual dates, not ranges
2. Verify files were actually saved before marking as processed
3. Implement proper error recovery

### Next Steps

1. Restart server with fixes
2. Force re-download of all June data
3. Verify today's recordings are captured
4. Implement monitoring mode properly
